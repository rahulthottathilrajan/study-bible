    commentary: "J. Alec Motyer writes that the Hebrew word 'almah' in Isaiah 7:14 invariably refers to a young woman of marriageable age whose virginity is assumed — and that Matthew's inspired use of the Greek 'parthenos' (unambiguously 'virgin') is the Holy Spirit's own interpretation of Isaiah's sign. The sign is deliberately supernatural: a birth that transcends natural generation, pointing forward to the incarnation of the eternal Son. Edersheim notes that the rabbinical tradition before Christ's birth understood this passage Messianically, making Matthew's application not a Christian imposition but a fulfilment of existing expectation.",

But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.

    commentary: "Walter Kaiser calls Isaiah 53 'the Mount Everest of Messianic prophecy' — the most detailed portrait of the atonement in the entire Old Testament, written seven centuries before Calvary. The passage describes vicarious suffering (bearing another's guilt), substitutionary death (the LORD laying iniquity on him), and the response of healing faith — all with a precision that can only be explained by divine revelation. Motyer demonstrates that the Servant cannot be identified with Israel corporately, as the Servant suffers on behalf of 'my people' (Isaiah 53:8) — a distinction requiring a personal, individual Messiah. The Dead Sea Scrolls copy of Isaiah 53, dating to 125 BC, is word-for-word identical to the Masoretic text — proving the prophecy predates Jesus of Nazareth by generations.",

    commentary: "Micah identifies not merely the tribe (Judah) but the specific village — Bethlehem Ephrathah, distinguishing it from a second Bethlehem in Zebulun. The phrase 'whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting' (Hebrew: 'mime olam') is used elsewhere in Scripture exclusively of God himself, indicating that the one to be born in Bethlehem pre-existed his own birth — a direct pointer to eternal deity entering time. Edersheim notes that the chief priests and scribes quoted this passage to Herod without hesitation (Matthew 2:5), confirming it was understood Messianically before Christ's birth.",

    commentary: "Zechariah 9:9 is one of the most precisely fulfilled prophecies in Scripture — specifying not just the city, the king, and the occasion, but the exact mode of transport. Kaiser notes that a king riding a donkey in the ancient Near East was a deliberate symbol of peace (a warhorse signalled military conquest), making the scene a royal claim dressed in humility. Jesus' deliberate arrangement of the colt (Matthew 21:2-3) indicates his conscious intention to fulfil this prophecy on the precise day of his public presentation to Israel — a detail that harmonises with Daniel's 70 Weeks calculation.",

    commentary: "This prophecy contains three independently verifiable details: the specific sum (thirty shekels — the price of a gored slave, Exodus 21:32, a deliberate insult), the action (casting them down), and the destination (the potter). Matthew 27 records all three fulfilled in sequence through the independent decisions of Judas, the Sanhedrin, and the temple authorities — none of whom were coordinating to match a prophecy. Motyer observes that the cumulative probability of these three details occurring by chance in combination is effectively zero, constituting strong evidential confirmation of predictive prophecy.",

John's Gospel presents Jesus as the true Passover Lamb — and records that the Roman soldiers, contrary to standard crucifixion procedure (crurifragium), did not break his legs because he was already dead. John explicitly identifies this as Scripture fulfilment, drawing together the Passover typology and the Davidic Psalm into a single moment of divine precision. Edersheim notes that the convergence of Roman military procedure, Jewish religious law, and prophetic Scripture in this moment is one of the strongest evidences of providential design in the Passion narrative.",

    commentary: "Peter's Pentecost sermon in Acts 2 applies Psalm 16:10 directly to the resurrection of Jesus, arguing that David himself died and his tomb was known in Jerusalem — therefore he could not be speaking of himself. The key term 'corruption' (Hebrew: shachath) refers to physical decomposition. Peter's argument, delivered in Jerusalem within weeks of the crucifixion to people who could verify or deny the empty tomb, is one of the most historically audacious claims in the New Testament. Kaiser notes that the apostolic interpretation of Psalm 16 is not eisegesis but the plain reading of a Psalm that exceeds anything David personally experienced.",

    commentary: "This is a typological fulfilment — Hosea 11:1 originally referred to Israel's Exodus from Egypt, yet Matthew applies it to the infant Jesus. This reflects the biblical-theological principle that Jesus recapitulates Israel's history, succeeding where Israel failed. As God's true Son, Jesus relives Israel's story: the flight to Egypt, the return, the crossing of water (baptism), the forty days in the wilderness, and the giving of the law (Sermon on the Mount). Motyer and Kaiser both affirm that this typological reading was available within the Old Testament's own categories — the pattern was always pointing forward.",

The gold head is identified as Babylon itself (v.38). The silver chest (Medo-Persia) conquered Babylon in 539 BC. The bronze torso (Greece) conquered Persia under Alexander the Great in 331 BC. The iron legs (Rome) subjugated the Hellenistic world from 168 BC. The feet of iron and clay represent the divided empire. In Daniel 7, the same four kingdoms appear as four beasts — lion, bear, leopard, and a terrible beast with iron teeth — each confirmed by Greek and Roman historians including Herodotus, Polybius, and Livy. No human writing a unified history in 603 BC could have predicted this sequence with such precision.",

    commentary: "Sir Robert Anderson's landmark calculation in 'The Coming Prince' (1894) demonstrated that Daniel's 69 weeks (7 + 62) represent 483 prophetic years of 360 days each = 173,880 days. Starting from Artaxerxes' decree to Nehemiah (Nehemiah 2:1, 1 Nisan, 445 BC) and counting 173,880 days forward lands on 6 Nisan, AD 32 — the very day Jesus rode into Jerusalem on a donkey in his Triumphal Entry. Luke 19:41-44 records Jesus weeping over Jerusalem because they did not 'know the time of thy visitation' — a direct reference to Daniel's timetable. The 70th week (7 years) is understood by most scholars as yet future. Anderson's calculation, verified by modern astronomy using Julian calendar conversion, remains one of the most mathematically precise fulfilments of prophecy ever documented.",

Alexander conquered the Persian Empire (the two-horned ram of v.20) with legendary speed — 'touched not the ground' — defeating Darius III at Gaugamela in 331 BC. At the height of his power the 'great horn was broken' — Alexander died suddenly in Babylon in 323 BC, aged 32.

    commentary: "Zechariah 12:10 contains an extraordinary grammatical feature: 'they shall look upon ME whom they have pierced' — God himself speaks, yet refers to being pierced. John's Gospel applies this verse directly to the crucifixion ('they shall look on him whom they pierced,' John 19:37), and Revelation 1:7 extends it to the Second Coming. The future fulfilment anticipated here is a national turning of Israel to Christ at his return, corresponding to Paul's declaration that 'all Israel shall be saved' (Romans 11:26) when 'the Deliverer shall come out of Zion.' This is perhaps the most poignant prophecy in Scripture — the moment of recognition, mourning, and reconciliation.",
